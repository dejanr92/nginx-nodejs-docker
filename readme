docker run example:

docker run -it -v /my/folder:/var/apps -p 8080:80 thisimage

Bind your sites folder in /var/apps
the root of /var/apps should have a file named sites where you have your sitename and exe path to it
first is the domain name you will add in your hosts and use and the second is the path to the file relative to your mount point


sites file example:
firstapp.app firstiste/bin/www
secondapp.app secondone/some.js

Folder structure example:
rootfolder bound to /var/apps
->sites
->firstside
->->bin 
->->->www
->secondone
->->some.js

Domains added in your hosts file:
127.0.0.1 firstapp.app 
127.0.0.1 secondapp.app 

To access them open your appname in your browser with the host forwarded port 
firstapp.app:8080



The port in your application has to be obtained dynamically for example use
var port = process.env.PORT; to define it
